# dotfiles

These are my .dotfiles. There are many like it but my .dotfiles are mine and I love them.

## Using these .dotfiles

I wrote a script to install all this. A script which I have yet to test.

Run that script with this one command after a fresh Arch Linux install:

```
bash <(curl -s https://github.com/linuxdotexe/.dotfiles/blob/archQtile/configs/install.sh)
```
